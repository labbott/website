title: And though scary is exciting nice is different than good

I've been at [Flock](http://www.flocktofedora.org) all week. This morning I was
on a panel with other mentors/organizers for Fedora's outreach programs
(Outreachy/Google Summer of Code). One of the questions for the panel was
about career advice for getting a job in open source. Everyone had thoughtful
responses. There was a lot of discussion about making sure you had good
communication skills. There was also a quote about how there are enough
smart people on the planet we need more friendly people. This felt really
weird to me and I didn't say anything more on stage because I didn't really
have my thoughts organized. I think it boils down to that phrase is a good
goal but there's more to unpack there.

"Wow Laura, are you saying we should all be mean to each other?" No. If that's
your first thought you probably should think about being friendlier. It's the
fact that this seems to be a dichotomy. You either get to be smart or you get
to be friendly, not both at the same time. This goes double (at least) for
under represented groups in
tech. I get depressed every time I read about another women in tech who is
told she isn't "technical enough" (whatever that means) because she has good
public speaking skills. I'm very tired of being told I'm intimidating for
reasons that seem to boil down to I'm pretty good at my job.
"Is this e-mail too aggressive because I
didn't use emoji or am I not going to be taken seriously if I do use emoji"
is always a fun thought process when attempting to write e-mail. Telling
people to be "friendly" is lousy advice if you are from a group whose is
penalized for _not_ being friendly vs. a group who is rewarded when they
_are_ friendly.

The overall point about communication skills is generally good advice. I'd
also couple it with advice for under represented groups to not sell yourself
short in other areas too, you can have all the skills! I really liked
the suggestion from the panel about blog posts. Writing gives you the chance
to demonstrate your skills by showing how well you can communicate your ideas.
What also needs to be emphasized is that communication skills are _skills_.
You can learn communication skills. You can learn technical skills. You can
learn non-technical skills. You can learn skills that don't fit into either of
those boxes. Have a lot of skills _and_ be friendly. Demand both from your
coworkers, managers, and managees.
