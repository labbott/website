1. [Starbucks in SLU](https://goo.gl/maps/yfvyk1Twx7y)
2. October 11th
3. Short mocha and coffee cake
4. This was literally the first ride I did after buying the bike. Mostly
practicing the basics of urban biking. By basics I really mean basic basics
like starting/stopping/shifting. Mercer is quite good and has nice dedicated
bike lane for part of it.  I struggled going uphill on the way back because I
hadnâ€™t quite figured out how gears worked.
5. 2 miles
