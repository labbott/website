title: Linaro Connect US '15
categories: fedora, kernel
---
One of the items that came out of Linux plumbers for me was discussion on
the future of the Ion memory manager for Android. While not as relevant
to my day to day work anymore, I still have a lot of background knowledge
and input to give. [Linaro Connect](http://connect.linaro.org) happened
a little over a month after plumbers and I was up there for the week,
mostly for Ion and other ARM talks. (Non-technically, being at Linaro
Connect also meant I could avoid the chaos in my apartment from an impending
move. Yay for convenient excuses!)

Most of my time was spent in a hacking room doing regular Fedora work and
chatting with people. I made some good progress on the bisection scripts.
A few sessions I attended:

- There's on going work on getting a
[generic driver](https://sfo15.pathable.com/meetings/302831)
for ARM Trustzone merged
into the kernel. This is what Linaro is really good at: figuring out what's
common between existing platforms and turning it into something generic.
The end result should be something which makes communication between the
secure and non-secure world more standard. The base design is currently
based on the OP-Tee secure environments. Hopefully this will be a good base
for others to expand into.

- In more OP-Tee work, Linaro is working on [DRM](https://sfo15.pathable.com/meetings/302837) (not the graphics) for end to end encryption. This more
standardization work on Linaro's part. Some of my previous worked on Ion
ended up overlapping with this although most of the discussion went over my
head.

- My favorite keynotes were probably the last day.
[Karen Sandler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GOCsXT8jas) talked about
open source compliance and her story. I've seen her give a variation of this
talk before but she's an excellent speaker. It's always good to be reminded of
exactly why compliance is necessary. 

- There was also a group panel
discussion on [security](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTeT6yC915Y).
The panel echos a lot of themes that are popular these days.
Everyone agrees that security is good but security is hard. There's been a
big push in the kernel to "elimiate entire classes of bugs" (to borrow a phrase
from Kees in the video). Convincing everyone to have the right security
mindset can be difficult though (and even [the best](http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2015/q4/83) need to be reminded to think a bit deeper). The Internet of
Crap^WThings is another can of worms. Most cell phones are
[vulnerable](http://www.zdnet.com/article/android-security-a-market-for-lemons-that-leaves-87-percent-insecure/) because they are running old version of
software. Imagine that on every object in your home. Here's hoping the
security conversation not only continues but is productive.

- I did have quite a few meetings about Ion and related work. I'll discuss
those in a later post.

- I didn't end up in any of the ARM server topics this time because of some
schedule conflicts. There's been both some [skepticism](http://www.theplatform.net/2015/10/06/why-are-we-still-waiting-for-arm-servers/) and
[hilights](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-10-08/qualcomm-shows-off-first-server-chip-in-effort-to-expand-reach) of the future of the ARM server.
Linaro connect is always thoroughly in the "We will prevail" camp for
obvious reasons. It's nice to drink the Kool-Aid sometimes. When the rose
colored glasses come off though, ARM servers only make sense as a long term
prospect. Building an ecosystem takes time. Getting hardware that correctly
conforms to standards and convincing manufacturers to
[get stuff upstream](https://lwn.net/Articles/659347/) is a long term
proposition. The market likes competition and anything that might put pressure
on Intel long term is going to be something to watch.
