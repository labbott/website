title: Kernel community management

I was at [Open Source Summit](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/open-source-summit-north-america-2018/)
last week (full trip report forthcoming) and like always one of the keynotes
was Linus being interviewed by Dirk Hohndel. The topic of the kernel community
and community management came up and whether Linus thought the kernel needed
to do anything more to grow. Paraphrasing, his response was the success of
the kernel community shows that it's generally doing fine. I disagree with
some aspects of this and have actually thought a lot about what community
management would mean for the kernel.

Community manager is a job that many modern source projects above a certain
size seem to have. If you google for "open source community manager" you'll
find lots of different descriptions of what the job entails. Lots of people
who actually have experience with this (i.e. not me) have [written](https://opensource.com/tags/community-management)
and [spoken](http://www.communityleadershipsummit.com/) about this work. The
big thing for me is that community management is a deliberate choice to shape
the community. You have to make the choice to build the community you want to
see. Even if you don't have a community manager, developers are still doing
community management every time they interact, because ultimately that's the
community.

A better question than "does the kernel need a community manager" is "does
the kernel need community management" to which I give an emphatic yes. The
kernel has certainly been a successful project but people have pointed out [some](https://www.labbott.name/blog/2017/04/03/complaining-about-the-kingdom-of-kernel/)
[issues](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BB0luXmuo3g).
Again, community management is about making choices to actively build a
community. You can't have a stream of maintainers unless you actively work to
make sure people are coming in. The kernel community is great at attracting
other people who want to work on the kernel but that may not be enough. The
kernel is way behind in terms of continuous integration and other tools
most people expect from open source projects these days. One area we need
to grow is people who work on tools to support the kernel. That pool may need
to come from outside the traditional kernel development community.

The role of the [TAB](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/about/technical-advisory-board/)
in community management is an interesting one. If you look at the description
on that page, "The Technical Advisory Board provides the Linux kernel community
a direct voice into The Linux Foundationâ€™s activities and fosters
bi-directional interaction with application developers, end users, and Linux
companies." I know there are some unfavorable opinions (and conspiracy
theories) out there about the Linux Foundation. What the Linux Foundation does
well is help guide corporations in doing open source which is very different
from grassroots free software. There's a large number of companies who have
become very active members of the kernel community thanks to guidance and
support from developers like those who are on the TAB. Enabling companies
to contribute successfully _is_ a form of community building as a practicality;
companies have different needs and requirements than individuals. I do believe
the members of the TAB deeply care about the kernel community, including those
who aren't part of any corporate entity. Figuring out how to set that
direction may be less obvious though.

Anyone who says they have the magic solution to community management is lying
and I certainly don't have one. I do believe you have to shape your community
with intentionality and just focusing on the code will not achieve that.
