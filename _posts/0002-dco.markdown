title: Please sign off your patches

One aspect of open source that appeals to many people is the idea that anyone
can contribute. All it takes is a great idea, a little bit of work, and you
can have fame, glory, and more conference t-shirts than you know what to do
 with. The reality is often not quite as simple for many reasons. A common
complication is software licencing. There are [plenty](https://www.google.com/?q=open+source+software+license+intro) of [other](https://www.fsf.org/news/) [locations](https://sfconservancy.org/blog/)
[talking](http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org) about open source software licencing and
the complications there of so this one will be narrowly
focused and have a simple request: When submitting patches for the Linux
kernel, whether to official kernel mailings lists or to Fedora, please
remember sign off your patches.

Luis Rodriguez has a great [blog post](http://www.do-not-panic.com/2014/02/developer-certificate-of-origin.html) on the history of the DCO. In over simplfied
terms, the
DCO is an assertion of 'Yes, I am permitted to include this code in
this open source project'. Many projects, including the Linux kernel, require
this assertion before taking any patch. Adding it is simple enough: simply
add `Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@e-mail.address>` to the bottom of your
commit text. If you can make the assertions in http://developercertificate.org,
you can add a Signed-off-by. 

Is the Signed-off-by needed in all patches? Yes. Even cleanup patches? Yes.
Even patches that just add a few device ids? Yes. Even patches that don't do
anything useful? If a patch isn't useful it shouldn't be getting merged, but
yes. A pattern I've seen a few times is

* Person has problem
* Person googles for problem
* Person finds someone else had the same problem, someone else had a fix for
the issue
* Person tests the fix -- it works!
* Person excitedly e-mails the fix to maintainers to get it included

Often the fix lacks a proper DCO so even if the patch is perfect in any other
way, the maintainers cannot take the patch. This leaves everyone feeling 
frustrated. But just because a patch was submitted
once without a proper DCO doesn't mean it can't be re-submitted later; if you
can get in contact with someone (e.g. original author, co-maintainer) who can
make the assertions of the DCO, the patch can be resubmitted. Until that
happens though there isn't much the maintainers of the project can do with
the patch.

It's vital to the success of open source projects that licences are followed.
So please, if you want your patch included make sure to add your
Signed-off-by.
