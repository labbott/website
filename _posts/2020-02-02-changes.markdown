I mentioned this on twitter and the Fedora kernel mailing list but January 17th
was my last day at Red Hat. I can't express enough thanks to every single
person I met during my nearly 5(!) years there. I came in to Fedora as
basically an outsider and everyone welcomed me with open arms. You all
touched my life in ways I will never forget. I enjoyed all the challenges
of being a kernel maintainer and working to make things better.

I started my new role at [Oxide Computer](https://oxide.computer) on January
20th. I'm very excited to be working with this team to solve real industry
problems and learn new and exciting things about hardware and software. I'm
not doing Linux kernel work on a day-to-day basis at the moment but I still
expect to be around the community. I'm still on the [TAB](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/about/technical-advisory-board/)
and I'm still on the Linux Plumbers planning committee (yes the website will
be up soon). Start ups move fast so we'll see what I end up working on.

Here's to new changes in 2020!
