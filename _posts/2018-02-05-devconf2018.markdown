[DevConf 2018](https://devconf.cz/cz/2018) happened. A grand time was had by
me (and hopefully others)

Robbie Harwood gave an overview of [Kerberos for Developers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFZ69r5QXKA).
Kerberos has a reputation for being difficult to use and manage. As far as I
can tell, maintaining a server can still be tricky but using it as a developer
has improved significantly. There are several libraries available, including
bindings in python which were demoed. Although I don't do much with Kerberos
applications usually, it's good to know there are easy to use APIs available.

There was a joint presentation on [Hardware Root of Trust](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpBQKT9m4dQ).
This was an overview of current TPM support. TPMs have historically been
somewhat controversial as they have been associated with reducing user freedom.
TPMs are also very good at providing a secure way to store keys for protecting
data, which was much of the focus of the talk. There's been ongoing work to make
TPMs do [useful](https://blog.dowhile0.org/author/jmartinezc/) things such
as disk encryption. The TPM software support has come a long way and I look
forward to seeing new uses.

Ulrich Drepper gave a talk on [processor architectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=InLQCcPt7Uo).
This seemed very timely given the recent speculative execution shenanigans.
There was a lot of focus on the existing Intel architecture and its
limitations. We're beginning to hit physical limits to increase speed (see
the slides about memory power use). As processor architectures get more
complex, compilers and programmers have to improve as well. Sometimes I do
miss working with hardware (until it breaks of course).

Don Zickus talked about some ongoing [Kernel CI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYBu13CBmo8) work.
The upstream kernel project has had some level of continuous integration (CI)
for a while now. One of the best known efforts is Intel [0-day](https://01.org/lkp/documentation/0-day-test-service)
testing. Don talked about why Red Hat is interested in supporting something
similar for upstream patches (it's easier to prevent buggy patches from being
merged than to fix them later!). I've been following this project for a while
now and look forward to see it come to fruition in the near future.

Randy Barlow and Patrick Uiterwijk talked about [rebuilding containers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqY-r-mU1To).
This seems like a task that's very easy (You just rebuild them right?) but it
turns out to be difficult to coordinate across the entire project. They talked
about an abandoned approach and the current method using buildroot overrides.

Several members of the Fedora council ran a [Fedora panel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HCrIoKgalic).
This was an open QA session and all the panelists gave thoughtful answers
to questions (as you'd expect). The video is worth watching to see the topics
covered.

Thorsten Leemhuis talked about [regressions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kl4kum3O5sI)
in the Linux kernel. This is a task he's picked up [somewhat recently](https://lwn.net/Articles/738216/)
and is important to me as both a kernel developer and a distro maintainer. His
talk emphasized why users are so important to regression tracking and the
basics of such work. This was a very good reference and I hope to link to it
in the future.

There was a talk about [out-of-tree modules](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eAffQYvDrt4).
Fedora has a policy of not shipping out of tree modules mostly for practical
reasons. Sometimes users have reasons for wanting to use out of tree modules
though and they are free to do so. The biggest issue tends to be keeping the
external module in sync with the tree. The talk covered ways maintainers can
keep modules in sync as well as methods for users to rebuild (akmods etc.).
Having good information on out of tree modules is important for those users
who want/need them.

Transitioning packages from python2 to python3 is ongoing. There was a talk
about some of this [work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2retZzzVVA).
It's easy to get supposedly simple changes like a name change wrong. I don't
have nearly as much experience with packaging as some people so this was a
nice review of packaging in addition to a good set of lessons learned.

Patrick Uiterwijk talked about [autosigning](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0UaOSmMf1LM).
Users rely on digital signatures to provide some level of trust on the packages
they get from Fedora. Much of the signing work use to be done manually by
humans who are prone to human failures. Patrick and others have worked hard
over the last year to have more signing happen automatically. This talk was a
nice overview of Fedora root of trust and a discussion of what exactly it takes
to keep that trust.

I had a good time meeting everyone and look forward to another DevConf.
