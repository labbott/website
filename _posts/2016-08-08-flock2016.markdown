The annual [Flock](http://www.flocktofedora.org) was held last week in Poland.
This year was much busier for me than [last year](http://www.labbott.name/blog/2015/08/17/flock-2015-and-being-new-in-town/).
I've been on the team for well over a year now (my how time flies!) so I was
more involved with everything.

I gave the annual kernel talk. This was mostly a status report/update. If
you've been to Flock in the past, this talk will seem very familiar. One item
I tried to emphasize this year was that we really wanted to get more people
involved. Our policy is still 'go upstream' but we still want to build an
active Fedora community of kernel participants as well. The distro is probably
going to be most users first interaction with the kernel and we want the best
experience possible. The [slides](https://labbott.fedorapeople.org/FedoraKernelFlock2016.pdf)
are super boring but you can read them if you want.

I also did a workshop on building the kernel. This was designed to walk people
through building a kernel and applying patches to the kernel. There were a
handful of people in the room but everyone was engaged and asked great
questions. I learned about `dnf builddep` for installing requirements and we
corrected a problem with the dependencies as well. Overall it was a good use
of a workshop slot.

During the Q/A portion of the kernel talk and afterwards, I got a lot of
questions about getting started contributing to the kernel. A common theme was
"Oh yeah! I always wanted to do kernel things but I don't know how to get
started". I decided to do a lightning talk about first steps. Getting started
in the kernel is an open problem the community is still working on. My
suggestions included [kernel newbies](https://kernelnewbies.org/FirstKernelPatch) and the [eudyptula challenge](http://eudyptula-challenge.org/).
Writing up a longer post on this is on my TODO list.

Apart from times where I was talking, I went to a handful of other talks. I
attended several sessions about diversity and community building. I'm happy to
see the Fedora community having these conversations and I hope to see more in
the future. Peter Robinson gave the usual state of Fedora ARM. The most
significant news was the [redefintion of primary and secondary architectures](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/devel@lists.fedoraproject.org/thread/3BO5E2XZ2D7BHK7GQXZB5S37AQIUN6YP/).
Discussion about this has been happening for a while so it's good to see this
make forward progress to give arm64 a much needed bump.

I did a bunch of hallway track. Still my favorite track. I'm still terrible at
putting faces to names but I like meeting people. Thanks to all the Flock
organizers who put together a great conference.
