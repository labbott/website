I never posted about it but I was elected to the [TAB](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/about/technical-advisory-board/)
last November. I'm deeply appreciative towards several people who reached out
and encouraged me to run. I probably wouldn't have run if they hadn't done
so, which is a lesson for me personally and communities in general. Having
served a few months now, I have some thoughts on the TAB. This is me speaking
in my personal capacity as a kernel developer and not for the TAB as a group
or any other individuals.

The first question everyone seems to ask is "What exactly does the TAB do?"
The answer to that is tied to the history of the TAB. Most of this happened
well before my time and is probably better documented elsewhere but the
short summary is the TAB came about from the creation of the Linux Foundation
from OSDL. There really wasn't a good forum where kernel developers could have
a voice, thus the TAB was born. While the name is "Technical Advisory Board",
it's designed to cover the kernel community. The TAB Chair also has a seat on
the Linux Foundation Board[^1]. Over the years, the TAB has worked
on everything from UEFI to encouraging corporate participation to combating
GPL trolling. As time passes and problems get solved, what the TAB spends its
time on also changes. The TAB has sometimes been compared to other open source
project boards but one important note is that the TAB is not responsible for
technical decisions directly. It's not the place of the TAB to sign off or
approve architecture changes.

The most succinct phrase I can think of to describe the TAB is "service to
the kernel community". All the work the TAB does should be for
the benefit of the kernel community. Saying kernel development is all
about the code is a pretty big lie. You will not be successful in kernel
development without the ability to communicate. Some of those skills from
working on the kernel can transfer to work on the TAB but not all kernel
developers may be interested in using those skills in another forum.
Part of the advantage of having a group like the TAB is that those people
who do care about particular issues can help find solutions to make everyone's
life easier. Small groups taking the lead (and being transparent) is one way
to scale growing communities. The reason to serve on the TAB is because you
want to solve problems that will be brought to the TAB. Sometimes those
problems will have a technical slant (UEFI for example) but many times the
issues are people focused (code of conduct). Sometimes the TAB isn't the right
place to solve a problem but the TAB also serves as a resource to redirect
people to a more appropriate forum.

This is all still incredibly hand wavy but the point is the TAB is there
if people need it. It's useful to have a single body of people to ask questions
and help guide people  If _you_ have ideas of things the TAB should work on,
I'd welcome the chance to hear it.
