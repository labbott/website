April/May started the cycle of planning for the next year here in Red Hat. This
means it's time to write goals. Goals are supposed to be
[SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria). This is easier for
some parts of my job than others. One of
my primary responsibilities is making Fedora releases. While discussing my
goals, it was pointed out that just saying "Did I make releases?" doesn't
fully capture what I do. Scripts can make releases. I can't yet replace myself
with a script so this job must involve not being [useless](http://dilbert.com/strip/2016-03-28).

I'm now on rawhide for the 4.7 release so as an experiment I'm going to try
writing about what work goes into making some of the rawhide releases. I have
no idea if this will be valuable. At a minimum more people will get a chance to
see how the sausage gets made. Let's see what happens.
