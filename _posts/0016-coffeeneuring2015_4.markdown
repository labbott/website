1. [Milstead and Co. ](http://milsteadandco.com/)
2. October 31st (SPOOOOOKY RIDE)
3. Mocha with actual bittersweet chocolate and a cherry scone. Very pleasant.
4. It was rainy and and windy and yet I decided to go out today anyway. I fully
expected this to end up on my top 10 bad decision list. Except it was amazing
in every way. I’m finally beginning to get the good decisions from the bad
decisions of the past (Good decisions come from experience. Experience comes
from bad decisions). Wearing just the bike shorts makes moving my legs on and
off the bike so much easier. Rode down Mercer all the way on the street until I
got to the protected bike lane. Street riding felt very natural. Took the west
side part of the [Cheshiahud Lake Union loop](http://www.seattle.gov/parks/lakeunionloop/).
(Doing the full loop is now a goal) The not stopping every block for traffic
was a nice change of pace. I did have to stop for 5 minutes about 3/4 of the
way through because my right hand was getting stiff. (Too much of a death grip
on the handle bars? A sign I’m doomed to get carpal tunnel?) This route took me
right into Fremont which has a bunch of nice dedicated bike lanes. The coffee
shop had a bike rack but it was already full of bikes so I hooked up to a
parking sign. Since I was in the neighborhood, I went to the bike shop and
asked about my shifter. They worked on it while I pet the two dogs wandering
around the shop. (Wow such fluffy. Many pets). Based on what the technician
said, I think one of my bad decisions (a.k.a. falls) put something out of
alignment. I now know something to watch out for. I ended up taking the bus
back so as not to ruin my good ride and also because the wind was picking up.
No saddle soreness at all! I suspect giving myself a break to heal and wearing
proper padded shorts helped (also riding on less bumpy things). Overall a great
ride for me.
5. 3 miles
