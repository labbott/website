A short bio
===========

I'm Laura. I'm employed as a software developer. I mostly do Linux kernel work.
This is where I write about mostly technology related items and other things
that interest me. I can't write a bio to save my life but I should probably
write a better one. My interests outside of work are varied and include but
are not limited to: cooking, reading, skiing (poorly), yoga (poorly), biking.

I am still unwilling to relocate to San Francisco.
